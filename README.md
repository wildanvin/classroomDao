## Project description

I was inspired by this [article](https://fortune.com/2020/12/15/crypto-country-coin-brian-brooks-comptroller-of-currency-learning-student-incentives/).

TL;DR of the article:

'It is well stablished that higher literacy rates correlate to higher “gross domestic product,” then incentivizing people to continue their schooling could boost productivity, individual well-being, and societal prosperity. World governments would reward people with so-called "country coins" for continued learning. A student earns coins by completing online courses and passing tests. The coins would essentially represent claims on a “trust fund” set up by the state; they would entitle recipients to future payouts representing a share of the rising tax revenue generated by increased GDP.'

I really like this idea and I believe education is a key aspect for long term social prosperity and well being. But I don't think world governments (especially the developing ones) are going to implement this in the near future. So, this project is a MVP of this idea.

There are two smart contracts in this project, `ClassroomFactory.sol` and `Classroom.sol`. Through the front end, the teacher (or anyone who wants to create a classroom and share their knowledge) will interact with the `ClassroomFactory.sol` and create an instance of `Classroom.sol`, this new created `Classroom` instance is a multisig wallet that I modified slightly from the example found in [solidity-by-example.org](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/multi-sig-wallet) (that guy is awesome)

Every `Classroom` will be like a mini DAO, with a max of 21 participants (including the teacher) and will need the approval of 15 participants in order to execute a transaction.

Rigth now, an approved transaction will just distribute the funds evenly to the participants. For example, if I create a classroom with a duration of 4 weeks (or 4 sessions), and the participants manage to get 1 ETH for this classroom, the first approved transaction will send 0,0119 ETH (0.25 ETH / 21 participants) to each participant. Why 0.25 ETH? Because for each transaction, the bounty is divided by the number of sessions that the classroom has. So, the first transaction executed will distribute 0.25 ETH among the participants, the second transaction will distribute again 0.25 ETH, the third 0.25 ETH and finally the fourth transaction the remaining 0.25 ETH.

It would be awesome to use Coordinape to build the transaction and distribute the funds according to participation or other positive actions (help fellow students, complete homeworks, etc), but that will be for later.

## Deployed version URL

You can interact with de dApp in this [link](https://classroom-dao.vercel.app/). Please take into account that in this demo each classroom has a max of 3 participants and needs the approval of 2 to execute transactions. Of course you can change that in the contract `Classroom.sol` at lines 21 & 22 and redeploy

## Deployed Address

The `ClassroomFactory.sol` contarct is deployed in the Kovan network at `0x9F99a1B4ae3484460b9a812B46A321d749DE59d8`.

## Screencast Link

This is a demo locally in ganache, some UI is still incomplete. I will make a new video soon.

Video demo [part1](https://www.loom.com/share/4237986466b544c586444626be88ebbb) and [part2](https://www.loom.com/share/3aeabd92be5d41d383b6da447f12c314)

## How to run the project locally

### Prerequisites:

- npm >= 6.13.4
- node >= 12.16.1
- truffle
- ganache

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository in empty directory.
2. Open a new terminal and run `ganache-cli` you can use the GUI version of ganache too. Make sure ganache is accessible on port 8545. It should say something like `Listening on 127.0.0.1:8545`
3. Now, let's go back to the terminal where you cloned the project and run: `truffle migrate --network development`
4. Notice that the FE code is in the `client` folder. So, open a new terminal and run `cd client`. Now that we are in the client folder run `npm install`.
5. Now run `npm run dev` to spin up the react front end and the mock database.
6. You now should be able to interact with the contracts through the front-end in your beowser at localhost:3000
7. Now that you are on the front end don't forget to change the network in Metamask to Localhost:8545 and add an account using the mock private keys that ganache provides.

## Directory Structure

This project was bootstrapped with a react truffle box, so the project directory is kind of standard

- `client`: Contains a react app.
- `contracts`: Smart contracts.
- `migrations`: Migration files for deploying contracts in `contracts` directory.
- `test`: Tests for smart contracts. Right now no test is implemented

## Environment variables (not needed for running project locally)

If you want to deploy the contracts to the Kovan testnet, create a `.env` file in the same directory as the `truffle-config.js` and run in terminal `truffle migrate --network kovan`
